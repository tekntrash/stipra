<div align="left">
The Stipra Ecosystem is a product of TeknTrash: it the first service which effectively rewards people for proper recycling while providing companies with unique post-sales data. The ecosystem is made of an app, a monitoring website (corp.stipra.com), and a network of StipraPOD ("Point of Disposal") connected<br><br>

This repository is the android app of the Stipra system. The app uses the camera to read barcodes, send their data to a backend server, and finally the video to be processed. The backend then processes the video, looking for barcodes, checks with an online service what is the name of the product of that barcode, and if there is a reward associated. It then sends a message to the user with the points obtained<br><br>

This code is developed in Flutter and can run in Android and IOS
